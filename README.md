# Javascript Quiz

## Description
This quiz was developed to test users javascript knowledge and track the scores achieved in a set time. Users start the quiz by clicking the "Start" button. They are presented with several questions one at a time and can choose the correct answer by clicking on the multi choice option. They are told immediately if they are correct or wrong and the next question is automatically loaded. If they choose an incorrect answer the time is reduced by 5 seconds. They are finished when either the time is up or they have completed all questions. They are prompted for their initials and then their score is stored. They have the option to view the stored scores by clicking the High Scores link in the top left hand side of the nav. The time remaining is displayed in the top right of the nav.

The javascript quiz is developed using a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Noteworthy features are:
* Event listeners
* Use of a timer - setInterval and setTimeout
* Dynamic creation and display of elements in HTML page
* Use of local storage
* Converting between array of objects and string to store in local storage and vica versa
* Use of Object to store question and multi choice answers


The main challenges were dynamically changing the contents of the HTML while ensuring the user experience was intuitive and simple.
